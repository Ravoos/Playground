# Yahtzee Round Simulation Project

## Run the simulation
To run the Yahtzee round simulation, go to program.cs and make sure that:
```
	Playground.Projects.YahtzeeProject.Entry();
```
is not commented out.
Comment out any other project entry points if necessary.

Then, run the program. The simulation will execute a single round of Yahtzee, rolling the dice and displaying the results in the console.
